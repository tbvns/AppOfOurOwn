## 📖 How It Works  

This client functions by **scraping AO3**, allowing users to browse, search, and read works directly within a nice UI. It fetches data from the website while ensuring a smooth and mobile-friendly interface. Since AO3 does not offer an official API, scraping is used to retrieve and display content.

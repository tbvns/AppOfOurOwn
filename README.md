## 📖 How It Works  

This app functions by **scraping AO3**, allowing users to browse, search, and read works directly within the app. It fetches data from the website while ensuring a smooth and mobile-friendly interface. Since AO3 does not offer an official API, scraping is used to retrieve and display content.
